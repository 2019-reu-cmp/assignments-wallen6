1:  For loop is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence.
    While loops are used to do something as long as a certain condition is met.
    A for loop could be used to repeat a part of code so many times.
    A while loop could be used to determine if a number is positive or negative by
    having the loop print the result when the condition is met.
2:  
    
3:  f = open(filename, 'r')
    f.read()
    f.close()
    
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    f.read()
    
    
4:  You have to be careful with with statements because they can continue on
    forever if the conditions are not met. They are safe for working with
    files because they can only continue for as long as the data in the file
    is available.
    
5:  An iterable is something that contains data of some sort. Examples are
    lists, tuples, and generators. They can be helpful to call back to data
    without having to rewrite the same data over and over again.
